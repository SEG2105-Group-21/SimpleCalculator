# SimpleCalculator

Simple calculator app for Android devices.

The two edge cases covered in this calculator app are:

1. Equal button on clear screen does not crash the app

2. Using chained operations without clicking the equal sign
  -   Example:
  
    Before: User enters "1 + 1 + 1 + 1 =" the result will be "2"
    After: User enters "1 + 1 + 1 + 1 =" the result will be "4"
